This toolbox didn't work.

I wouldnt submit it, but I feel that I got a pretty good understanding for how
it should be working, and did a fair amount of work around trying to get it to
work. The issues I found were primarily that
a) the text didnt converge properly
  BECAUSE vv
b) the library errored after a single generation:
  ERROR:

  Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "evolve_text.py", line 229, in <module>
    pop, log = evolve_string(goal)
  File "evolve_text.py", line 198, in evolve_string
    stats=stats)
  File "/usr/local/lib/python3.5/dist-packages/deap/algorithms.py", line 165, in eaSimple
    offspring = varAnd(offspring, toolbox, cxpb, mutpb)
  File "/usr/local/lib/python3.5/dist-packages/deap/algorithms.py", line 78, in varAnd
    del offspring[i].fitness.values
AttributeError: 'str' object has no attribute 'fitness'

c) this seemed to be a library-side error, and thus no issue of mine.

If I need to do another toolbox let me know, but for now I am satisfied that I
learned a fair amount doing this one.

Also let me know before the redone one would be substantialy late

thanks!
